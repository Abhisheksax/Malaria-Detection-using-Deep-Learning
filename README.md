# Malaria-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

Malaria is a mosquito-borne parasitic infection spread by a female Anopheles mosquito infected by the Plasmodium parasite. It is a single-celled parasite that multiplies amongst the red blood cells of humans as well as in the mosquito’s intestine. When the female mosquito feeds on an infected person, the parasites are ingested along with the human blood. The parasites multiply in the mosquito’s gut and these infectious forms are passed onto another human when the mosquito feeds again.

To improve diagnosis, image analysis software and machine learning methods have been used to quantify parasitemia in microscopic blood slides. So I have implemented my CNN model for classification of Parasitized nad uninfected human cells from malaria

The results turns out that our was able to achieve a accuracy of 91% when trained on kaggle and 96% on my own desktop in classifying between the two categories of cells
